/A SUMMARY
This document explains the how to setup cgb.

/B SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
System requirements depends heavily on intended usage.  As of 2010, the UCSC Genome Browser at
http://genome.ucsc.edu has:

8 CPU cores
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU L5420  @ 2.50GHz
64 Gb of memory
38 Tb of disk space, 12 Tb currently used

From https://lists.soe.ucsc.edu/pipermail/genome-mirror/2010-September/002088.html

As of early 2012, an installation that serves a few dozen users has on the following:

8 CPU cores 
Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5450 @ 3.00GHz
16 Gb of memory
1 Tb of disk space, 333 Gb currently used

A test enviroment I have running on Fedora 16 is:

Intel(R) Core(TM) i7 CPU @ 2.67GHz
6 Gb of memory
500 Gb of disk space.

/C SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
cgb requires:

* A local install of the UCSC Genome Browser.
  See http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/mirror.html for how to install 
  the UCSC Genome Browser. You do NOT need to install a full mirror, 
  just the browser. For alternate instructions see 
  http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Browser_Installation.
  Keep in mind that a local installation of the UCSC Genome Browser
  requires Apache, MySQL, gcc, among other programs. See 
  http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/mirror.html for more information.

/D SETUP

To setup cgb:

1. Cgb requires that you have administrator access to Apache and MySQL.

2. Prepare an archive of the UCSC Genome Browser installaion.  Variables such
   as WEBROOT or CGI_BIN refer to http://genome.ucsc.edu/admin/mirror.html.
   
 * Move the cgi-bin directory i.CGI_BIN to within WEBROOT.  This makes generating a 
   complete archive easier.
 * Download hgcentral.sql and save it to WEBROOT. You can get a copy of hgcentral at:
   http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/admin/hgcentral.sql. Delete the INSERT and REPLACE 
   statements from hgcentral.sql.
 * Optional: To save disk space delete the directories goldelPath/help/examples and 
   ENCODE/ from WEBROOT.
 * Tar and compress WEBROOT:
   cd $WEBROOT
   tar cvzf ../$WEBROOT.tar.gz *

3. Setup .hg.conf:

 * If not already done so, setup a .hg.conf file in your home directory. 
   See http://genomewiki.ucsc.edu/index.php/Hg.conf for more details.  
   Mine looks like: 

   db.trackDb=trackDb
   db.host=localhost
   db.user=browser
   db.password=genome
   central.db=hgcentral
   central.user=hguser
   central.password=access
   central.host=localhost
   central.domain=
   
   Set the file mode to 600: chmod 600 ~/.hg.conf

4. Prepare files from jksrc:
 
 * Where you installed jksrc <some_path>/jksrc/kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/makefile, 
   modify the alpha rule by commenting out all command EXCEPT ./loadTracks.
 * In the <some_path>/jksrc/kent/src/hg/makeDb/trackDb/ directory, 
   backup the trackDb.ra file:
   
   $ mv trackDb.ra trackDb.bak
   $ touch trackDb.ra

   This avoids loading the hundreds of track definitions.


5. Create a customTrash database:
   
   In MySQL:

   create database customTrash;

6. Compile minimum program set from jksrc:

The following programs from the jksrc source code are required by cgb:
  
  faToTwoBit
  gfClient
  gfServer
  hgFindSpec
  hgGcPercent
  hgLoadWiggle
  hgsql
  hgTrackDb
  hgWiggle
  tdbQuery
  twoBitInfo
  twoBitToFa
  wigEncode

7. Set variables in cgb

   In the cgb script, edit the Setup variables to reflect your current setup.
